# Rhino Controls
The Rhino.UI.Controls namespace has many pre-build controls available for use in your UIs.
Using these controls allows you to look more like Rhino, to make your UI more intuitive to those already familiar with Rhino. There is also the added benefit that you don't need to write these controls yourself.

There are 40+ controls available currently, and this page will only go over a few examples.
